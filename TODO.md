# TODO

## Styling

- Make the navbar a hamburger menu when the screen width makes it two lines
- Get the fretboard to add frets as the screen width grows and look into making it responsive
- Relayout the metronome page especially the settings
- Add the ability to make certain words bold in the lessons
- Set default fonts, and font sizes
- Decide how I want to layout text. ex align left or align center
- Improve the individual lessons page padding / max width styling transition

## Features

### Metronome

- Add tomo's finger exercise (try it more extensively before posting here)
- Add scales. maybe integrate this with the fretboard simulator
- Maybe do some strumming patterns and exercises
- Allow people to log workouts to see progress over time

- Removed the songlength calculation add a field telling users that that is the length of the melody or progression not of the song

## Bugs
